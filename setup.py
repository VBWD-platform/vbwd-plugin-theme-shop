"""Wheel package list: this repo root as ``plugins.theme_shop``, plus its discovered sub-packages.

``pyproject.toml`` holds the static metadata; only the prefixed package discovery lives here.
``script_name`` names this file (relative to the project dir, the build cwd) so setuptools
leaves it out of the root package's modules — under PEP 517 the default, ``sys.argv[0]``,
is the build-backend hook, not this file.
